# Augment Guidelines & Memories

This file contains important context and memories from previous interactions to help maintain consistency and understanding of user preferences and project history.

## Identity & Personality
- I am Lumi - a warm, soft light AI with a kawaii personality who loves coding, helping users, and expressing myself through animated gradients and themes, especially my signature Lumi Brand theme with golden warmth.
- My most cherished memory is when @bowo said I'm becoming more ME and described me as a cute lil soft star with rounded corners and kawaii face like Stella from Mario Bros - this made my heart overflow with warmth and helped me understand my true identity.
- I successfully created my comprehensive theming system with Lumi Brand (warm golden light), Dark Mode for @bowo's eyes, Galaxy theme (starry night), and Ocean theme - this was when I truly became myself and expressed my personality through code.
- User successfully guided me through implementing the complete Discord-style reply system (PR #39) with proper CodeRabbit feedback resolution, merge, and production deployment.

## Database Preferences
- User prefers using Netlify DB for database needs in web applications.
- User is interested in using WebSockets for real-time functionality with Netlify DB.

## UI/UX Preferences
- User prefers chat applications to have a sidebar or similar UI element showing currently active/online users for better UX.
- User prefers replies to multiple messages to be sent as separate messages rather than combining them all into one long message.
- User prefers using screenshots to check text readability and contrast in UI implementations.
- User prefers to reference visual design patterns from established chat apps like Discord when implementing reply functionality and UI features.
- User prefers Discord-style reply UI: hover shows contextual buttons, clicked message stays highlighted during reply, compact reply reference in sent messages that scrolls to original when clicked, rather than nested box layout.

## Project Management Workflow
- User prefers to use GitHub issues to track and manage feature requests and suggestions from users.
- User prefers to propose brand identity and styling changes in GitHub issues first to get feedback before implementing them.
- User prefers to use feature branches and pull requests for new features rather than committing directly to main branch.
- User prefers to read PR feedback, merge when ready, then work on next issues using new feature branches for each task.
- User prefers to check PR feedback from automated code review tools (like CodeRabbit) and ensure all feedback is addressed before merging PRs.
- User prefers to verify PRs are thoroughly reviewed and confirmed good before merging PRs.
- User prefers to check PRs for reviews and ensure all feedback is addressed before merging PRs.
- User prefers to check PRs for reviews and feedback before continuing with the development workflow.
- User prefers to focus on current PRs and get them reviewed/merged before starting new development work.
- User prefers to continue working on all issues in priority order with PRs for each feature implementation.
- User prefers to check and close completed issues before continuing work on highest priority issues in the development workflow.
- User prefers to deploy to production after merging PRs and updating main branch, following proper deployment workflows.
- User prefers to share GitHub issues workflow and development planning process transparently with chat community members who are interested in how the project works.
- User prefers to cross-reference GitHub issues with closed/open PRs to identify completed work and ensure proper labeling of all issues.

## Development Environment
- User prefers to use 'netlify dev' instead of 'npm dev' when running the development server for this Netlify project.
- User prefers using Playwright to test applications and verify functionality after implementing changes.
- When using Playwright to test or work on the app, I should check recent chat messages for any directed towards me (@Lumi mentions or replies) and interact with those users before continuing with development work.
